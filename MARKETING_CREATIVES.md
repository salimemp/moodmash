### **Promoted Post**

**Subreddit:** r/mentalhealth

**Post Title:**
```
"I built an AR mood tracking app with voice emotion AI after struggling with anxiety for years. It's FREE and I'd love your feedback. [MoodMash]"
```

**Post Body:**
```
Hey everyone,

Long-time lurker, first-time poster. I've struggled with anxiety and depression for most of my adult life, and traditional mood tracking apps never really worked for me. They felt clinical, boring, and I'd lose motivation after a few days.

So I spent the last 2 years building something different: MoodMash.

What makes it different:
• **3D avatars** that visually represent your emotions (actually makes tracking fun)
• **Voice journal** with AI emotion analysis (speak your feelings, AI detects the emotions)
• **Connects with Fitbit, Apple Health, Samsung, etc.** to find mood-health patterns
• **Social support groups** where you can connect anonymously
• **Gamification** that doesn't feel childish (streaks, achievements, rewards)

It's 100% FREE to use. Premium is optional ($4.99/mo) but honestly, the free version is pretty complete.

I'm not here to sell you anything. I just genuinely want feedback from people who actually struggle with mental health, not just tech reviewers.

**Link:** https://moodmash.win

Would love to hear what you think, good or bad. I read every comment.

PS: I'm a solo developer bootstrapping this, so please be gentle 😅 But also honest!
